"""sgl_kernel compatibility shim for OSCAR dump path.

The vendored `sglang-dump-qkv` (older sglang fork) was built against an older
`sgl_kernel` that exports a handful of AWQ/GPTQ/Machete/Cutlass/FP4 legacy
symbols. The `coquant` conda env's newer `sgl_kernel` no longer exports
some of them.

OSCAR only ever dumps from BF16 or FP8 models, so the missing symbols are
never actually CALLED — they only fail at module import time. This shim
installs a fallback `__getattr__` on the `sgl_kernel` module so any missing
attribute returns a stub that raises NotImplementedError if it's ever
actually invoked. That lets all the import-time references succeed under
coquant env while preserving a clear error if anything in our dump path
unexpectedly does need a removed kernel.

Activated by adding this directory to PYTHONPATH; Python auto-imports
`sitecustomize` at interpreter startup before any application module runs.
